# Tab-Stack

A chrome extension, help you quickly switch among most recently active tabs.

Like ``` Alt (Option) + Tab ``` switcher in Windows, this extension display a tab list like the order display by Alt + Tab, that is, most recently tasks are on top of the task list.

For instance, you opened google.com, youtube.com, facebook.com and wikipedia.org in order, so now when you open this extension, it will show you a tab list like this:
* wikipedia.org
* **facebook.com**
* youtube.com 
* google.com

and it will automatically focus on facebook.com, the most recently opened tab.

It would be very handy when I need to switch between two tabs.

## Features

* ``` Alt (Option) + 1 ``` to open the extension to get the tab list in the order mentioned above.
* Keep ``` Alt (Option) ``` key down and press ``` Q ``` to move down in the list, or ``` W ``` to move up.
* You can also use ``` Up ``` or ``` Down ``` arrow to move.
* Release ``` Alt (Option) ``` key or press ``` Enter ``` to go to the chosen tab.
